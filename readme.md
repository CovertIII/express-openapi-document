# Express OpenAPI Document

This is used to document express APIs with the OpenAPI v2 in
code.  It can also be used to validate models for POST and PUT
requests.

This is still alpha quality and there are no tests. Use at your
own discretion.

Look at `examples/example.js` for an example on how to use this.

If you download this, run `npm install && npm run dev` to see the
example in action.  Go to `http://localhost:3000/spec.html` in
the browser and you'll see the swagger page.
