# Express OpenAPI Document

This is used to document express APIs with the OpenAPI v2 in
code.  It can also be used to validate models for post and PUT
requests.  There's a lot that can be done with this, but right
now it services a basic purpose.  Document and validate an
express API in code.

This is still alpha quality and there are no tests.

I've been using this access projects and need an npm module now
to track changes between all the versions.

Look at `examples/example.js` for an example on how to use this.

Go to `http://localhost:3000/spec.html` in the browser and
you'll see the spec.  Use the try feature of the Swagger doc to
actually use the API.
